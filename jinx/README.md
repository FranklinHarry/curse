# JINX: Jinx Is a Nonce eXtractor

JINX is a client to the CURSE SSH certificate signing server, which provides one-time use SSH certificates.

This software is currently in an alpha state and not recommended for use.

Requirements
------------
* OpenSSH 5.6+  
* CentOS 7
* Ubuntu 12.04+

Because SSH certificates are a relatively recent feature in OpenSSH, older versions of CentOS unfortunately do not support their use.
